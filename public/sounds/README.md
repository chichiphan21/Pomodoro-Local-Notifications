# Sound Files Directory

This directory contains notification sound files for the Pomodoro Timer app.

## Available Sounds:
- `default.mp3` - Default notification sound
- `bell.mp3` - Bell notification sound  
- `chime.mp3` - Chime notification sound

## Usage:
These files are referenced in the notification service to play different sounds when sessions complete.

## Note:
In a real implementation, you would add actual MP3 audio files here. For this demo, the files are referenced but not included as actual audio files.

To add real sound files:
1. Add your MP3 files to this directory
2. Make sure they are named correctly (default.mp3, bell.mp3, chime.mp3)
3. Update the notification service if needed to handle different sound formats
